# The Psychic Love-o-matic Test-o-bot

	- 2Â minds

### The Goal:
Score a perfect game of 12 points. If you can score 12 points with your partner then you are connected to them psychically and romantically.


### How to Play:

This game is played across 3 sets.

At the beginning of each set, the players put down their card at the same time.

If the patterns match then you win! Your team scores 4 points, picks the cards up and starts the next set.

If the patterns do not match then each player places a hand on their card. On the count of 3, both players rotate their pieces in an attempt to match their partner's. If they match then you win! Your team scores 3 points now instead of 4.

If the patterns do not match again then repeat the rotation step above except your team will only score 2 points instead of 3. Keep repeating this until you either match or there are no more points left.

To summarize the scoring: Points Score = 4 - Number of Turns.

That's it! Try to earn a perfect score of 12 points across 3 sets. If you're feeling extra connected, try to keep going on your perfect streak!
